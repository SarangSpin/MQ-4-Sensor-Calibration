# MQ-4-Sensor-Calibration
Code to convert raw input to corresponding ppm values of concentration

So I used this sensor primarily to detect the concentraion of methane in ppm for a project in determining whether the fruit is rotten or not. Overall with the code, I dont know whether they are true conc. values but the sure seem to work if you are using it for detection,alarm or etc.

This basically works with any MQ sensor, each sensor responds to different gases with some similar.
